# Shopping Cart

A simple React shopping cart application built as part of my learning journey.

##  What I Practiced & Learned
- **React Router**: Setting up multiple pages (Home, Shop, Cart) and enabling navigation with a persistent navbar.  
- **Component Structure**: Organizing components for clarity and scalability (Navbar, ProductCard, CartItem, etc.).  
- **State Management with Props**: Passing data and handlers between components for adding, removing, and updating items in the cart.  
- **Fetching Data**: Retrieving products from the [FakeStore API](https://fakestoreapi.com/) to simulate real-world e-commerce functionality.  
- **Dynamic Cart Updates**: Showing the total number of items in the navbar in real time.  
- **User Interaction**: Implementing input fields, increment/decrement buttons, and add-to-cart functionality.  
- **Styling**: Applying styles for a clean and user-friendly interface.

This project helped me bring together routing, data fetching, state management, and styling into a cohesive React application.
